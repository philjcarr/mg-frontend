	            	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	            	<p>We've said elsewhere about the value of the word and – it’s well known that success in music is all about 
	            		the team; that's you and whom you choose to work with. You already know that Music Gateway is here to help 
	            		you put together that team. But we want to help you in more ways than that. In life you learn from your 
	            		experiences and also take the advice of others. So we want to give you our personal advice and share with 
	            		you our knowledge through our own life experiences.</p>
					<p>We're like you, been there, done that, made some mistakes, but did it ouuuuur way. Actually we would 
						rather you didn't do it our way. We would rather you learn from our mistakes instead of repeating them. 
						So here's our A to Z guide to some of the key aspects of the music industry, along with some useful do's 
						and don'ts.</p>
					<p>This is really just an overview guide - though with some really crucial and useful stuff in it too. 
						We'll go into the different areas in more depth, with interviews and a lot more detail through our BLOG, 
						but for now, let’s start with...</p>
					<h2>A for ...</h2>

	            	<!-- A-Z Start -->
	                <a href="#one" class="accorLink first">
	                    A&amp;R
	                    <span class="arrow"><!-- Arrow --></span>
	                </a>
	                <div id="one">
	                    <p>	The title came from back in the day when the job involved finding the best songs for a singer or act 
	                    	to perform, hence the term artist and repertoire. Nowadays its come to be shorthand for...well, everyone 
	                    	has their own view. For some its the person who spots potential and builds a good working relationship 
	                    	which leads to musical success for the signing and a life of excess for the A&amp;R. For others it's 
	                    	the nephew or niece of one of the company directors who turns up late at gigs and huddles near the back 
	                    	with his or her fellow A&amp;R whilst they collectively form an individual opinion.</p>
	                    <p>Whatever your view on A&amp;R, its fair to say that if you want to sign a label or publishing deal, 
	                    	they - and their scout's out on point duty - are the people you'll need to impress. Like any profession, 
	                    	there's good and less good amongst the crowd but we believe that most of those signed bands that you love, 
	                    	were signed by good judgement rather than good luck.</p>
	                    <p>Research! There is little sense in targeting every label and publisher in existence. Research those that 
	                    	you think will be a good fit for the music you make. Don't rush it. If you feel the need to say 'This is 
	                    	where the guitar solo should go' every time you hear your demo, then its not finished. Remember you're 
	                    	trying to build a relationship. Do it right and you'll get more than one chance. Do it wrong, and you 
	                    	may not even get that. And don't worry too much about A&amp;R interest. Focus on being good. If you do 
	                    	that well enough, they will find you.</p>

	                    Band Agreements
	                    <span class="arrow"><!-- Arrow --></span>

	                <div id="two">
	                    <p>	If you play or sing, either on your own or with a few friends, then you are either an artist or a band. 
	                    	Even if you are a solo performer it's likely that you will use someone else's services somewhere along the way. 
	                    	Whether that's working with a producer, putting some strings on a recording or adding percussion to a live 
	                    	show in the same way that overnight success takes time. Solo success is a team thing.</p>
	                    <p> As with any project where more than one person is involved, it’s essential to establish some very clear guidelines 
	                    	from the outset - what do you want to achieve and how are you going to achieve it? Equally as important are, who 
	                    	owns what, who does what and who gets what? As we said, we've been where you are and amongst the team here at MG 
	                    	we've got artists and band members, so we know what it’s like when you start out making music with your friends. 
	                    	The last thing you want to do is have those tricky conversations about who works on what and who gets paid what - 
	                    	ou're all friends so you'll share it all equally, you'll always be friends so you'll never want that to be any 
	                    	different. Yeeeessss, ok. Of course bands or music projects never suffer from creative differences (often a 
	                    	euphemism for drummer or singer slept with bandmate’s wife / husband / pet) and line-up changes never occur.</p>
	                    <p> Ok, so maybe those kinds of things can happen, therefore it's best to be prepared, just in case. A simple band 
	                    	agreement will go a long way to preventing misunderstanding's from occurring, and also help to resolve any little 
	                    	issues before they become bigger issues. Yes it's a legal document, but when you start to work with other people 
	                    	you are automatically working under some form of legal framework anyway - a partnership agreement if you are in a 
	                    	band for example - so having a legal document to clarify and explain responsibilities and rewards makes sense. 
	                    	It doesn't have to be complicated, but it should cover all the obvious things such as how is income to be split 
	                    	and the less obvious things such as who owns the rights to the name. It doesn't have to be expensive and the 
	                    	Musicians Union have an excellent version available for download. We said this is in part about learning from 
	                    	OUR mistakes, and there is at least one member of the MG team who heartily wishes he had insisted on a band 
	                    	agreement being in place. So...</p>
	                    <p> + Do have a band agreement. Simple as that.</p>
	                    <p> + Do have those difficult conversations.</p>
	                    <p> + Don't leave those aforementioned difficult conversations till it’s too late. Have them upfront. You're much 
	                    	less likely to fall out over a percentage of very little or nothing.</p>
	                    <p> + Don't think that because you're great friends that none of this matters. It does. And having a band agreement 
	                    	is a great way of staying great friends.</p>

	                <div id="seven">
	                    <p>	There are two main forms of copyright that concern us:</p>
	                    <p> 1. The copyright in the SOUND RECORDING. This comes into existence when you make a recording of a musical creation. 
	                    	That could be something as simple as recording a song on your home studio set up or it could be a full-blown 
	                    	Abbey Road session. Usually whoever pays for the session or owns the recording equipment owns the copyright to that 
	                    	particular sound recording (known as the master rights).</p>
	                    <p>Technically every new recording is a new master right though in practice the term 'Master Recording' usually applies 
	                    	to the final, finished version. The master rights holder allows reproductions to be made of the recording for an 
	                    	agreed set of terms. Those terms usually include a period for which the rights can be copied (i.e. for which copies 
	                    	of the record can be made) and how much will be paid to the master rights holder in return.</p>
	                    <p> 2. The copyright in the COMPOSITION (the words and music). This is separate and distinct from the Sound Recording. 
	                    	A song can only be created once, but it can be recorded many times by many artists. Each different version is a new 
	                    	sound recording of that original composition. Each new sound recording will generate royalties for those involved 
	                    	with that particular recording but every version will generate royalties for the songwriter(s) or composers who created 
	                    	that composition.</p>
	                    <p> The copyright in the composition comes into existence automatically at the moment its creator captures it in a tangible 
	                    	or repeatable form. For example, that could be when it’s sung onto a recording device such as a mobile phone answer 
	                    	service or when it's written onto sheet music and so on. It exists and you own it.</p>

	                    <p>	Much has been said about the demo recording and we're sure you are all familiar with the tales of unheard demo's sitting piled 
	                    	up lonely and dust covered, in A&amp;R offices. Whilst that may be just an urban myth there is a grain of truth and a lesson to 
	                    	be learned from that scenario.</p>
	                    <p> Firstly, it's very hard to make a decent tower-like structure out of MP3's so that image no longer works. However, whilst the method 
	                    	of delivery has largely changed the requirements of the demo haven't. In fact, because it is arguably now easier to get your songs 
	                    	into the building, the challenge of actually getting them heard is now even greater. Whether it’s sitting in a rarely visited corner 
	                    	of an office or sitting in a rarely opened file in the corner of a desktop, the challenge is still to get your demo heard.</p>
	                    <p>So how do you get it pulled out of the pile?</p>
	                    <p>Well, first and foremost, you concentrate on creating good music that is commercially viable for the scene or genre it sits in. That 
	                    	is to say, something saleable, something people will want to buy. And the way you demonstrate that is by... showing that people are 
	                    	prepared to pay money to hear your music. This might be sold out gigs or sold out short run singles or E.P's etc. The point is, the 
	                    	way to get your demo to the top of the ‘must listen to’ pile is to already be successful.</p>
	                    <p> Success is a relative thing, so it doesn't have to mean selling out a stadium tour but you should be showing at least a degree of 
	                    	following. So that's things such as FB likes, YouTube views, sales of releases and so on. In short, the more successful you are, the 
	                    	more the industry can see you have both the capacity for hard work and also that a market exists for your music and those are the 
	                    	things which will get your demo listened too. In fact, if you do it right, they will contact you to get hold of a copy.</p>
	                    <p> Keep it brief. 2 - 4 tracks maximum and don't forget to include contact details, particularly relevant if it's a physical copy because 
	                    	CD's and accompanying letters can easily get separated. Also, say something interesting about you/your band in the package. Hundreds 
	                    	of demos are looked at everyday; entertain those who are opening your package and show them why you are different and let them know a 
	                    	bit about you personally and your plans for the future. Personalise it!</p>

	                    <p>	We've all heard lots of those doom-laden statements along the lines of 'It's the end of the music industry'. It's not. Quite the opposite 
	                    	so move away from the lifeboats, the ship is not sinking. It is however changing course. Its compass is spinning like a top and it's on 
	                    	a new heading almost daily but that's probably because it no longer has just one Captain. It's being captained by the entire crew plus

	                    	pretty much daily, and it’s increasingly the music creators who are driving those changes.</p>
	                    <p> The advent of cheaper recording technology, combined with the ability to connect with a global fanbase via the web, means that the people 
	                    	who actually create the music have much more say in when and how they interact with the existing traditional elements within the music industry. 
	                    	For some it’s never, and they are happy to keep their projects on a genuinely 100% DIY basis. For others, developing their own career is their 
	                    	way to secure the traditional label or publisher support. For others it’s somewhere in between. The point is now more than ever before,

	                    	be done close by. The best way to become world famous is to start by being world famous in your hometown. We don't mean getting stopped in the street famous,

	                    <p>	Actually it's probably more accurate to say 'Work'. A phrase we hear all the time these days is 'Transferable skills' though it’s not something that is readily associated with 
	                    	music makers, but it should be. Say, for example, you're in a band. You're probably a musician or vocalist. When you're not involved in your own band stuff you might help 
	                    	friends out by adding singing some live backing vocal’s 's playing drums on some new recordings. Your musical ability is your 'Transferable skill'. Music Gateway allows you 
	                    	to take your transferable skills and offer them out to the wider market place (and it doesn't get much wider than globally). So, not only do you get to advertise your skills 
	                    	to a much bigger group than just your friends, but also, because you're not working for friends, you get to charge the going rate.</p>
	                    <p> This might sound obvious but make sure you take a professional businesslike approach to this. Agree terms, agree expectations and agree delivery dates and methods etc. Your 
	                    	skill will get you started but its skill and professionalism that will keep you getting work. And be realistic about your skill levels and skill sets; you'll get found out 
	                    	very quickly if you make claims that your ability can't back up. Being able to play Chopsticks really well does not make you a concert pianist. Your reputation is important 
	                    	so don't cheapen it.</p>

	                    	look it over and advise you. Some firms offer a free initial consultation but even if you're being charged if it helps you to avoid some of the pitfalls of the music industry

	                    <p> Do find a music industry specialist. Your local general legal firm may have some understanding of the basics of copyright law but it's a very specialised industry and its one 
	                    	that's changing all the time. Changing both in terms of new industry developments, practices, rights amendments etc but also in terms of context. That is to say what is a good 
	                    	deal. It's not just about the money it's also about what the act needs at that stage of their career and that's where having a specialist who knows the industry inside out and 
	                    	back to front will pay dividends. And don't just go with the first firm you speak to. Meet with a few. All have different styles and approaches and it's important that your 
	                    	lawyer gets you and what you want to achieve.</p>

	                    <p>	Just want to be clear that you have what's called Copyright Assignment and Copyright Licensing, assignment is for life of the copyright e.g. 70 years, whereas licensing is 
	                    	normally for a fixed term and based on a number of royalty and accounting conditions.</p>
	                    <p> Ideally, you should always look to retain your Music Copyright ownership and license your music to third parties on a non-exclusive basis, especially for sync and compilation 
	                    	use. Of course, any deal has to be taken in context of what's on the table, this sometimes doesn't have to be 'all about the money', if for example a license will give you huge 
	                    	exposure, then the benefits long term could be huge, so carefully consider all licensing opportunities, that's our advice.</p>

	                    	kind not the net kind). You have to catch the wave at just the right moment, and if you can get it to 
	                    	carry you all the way to the shore. Or it could dump you onto a jagged reef. Or just fizzle out. But 
	                    	there will always be another wave.</p>
	                    <p> Dragging that back to music, you have to be ready, musically ready which means fit for purpose, right 
	                    	for your goals. And the wider world has to be ready for you. So you'll either be fitting into a scene 
	                    	or developing one yourself, both of which require you to be fit for purpose, and so it goes. You're 
	                    	allowed to make mistakes and pick a wave that doesn't fully develop, but you'll need to learn from 
	                    	those mistakes and come back stronger for the next set.</p>

	                    	else is extremely important. One great way of getting exposure or your head above the musical parapet, is to 
	                    	cross musical genres with collaborations and to work outside the norm. Of course, great songs are all important, 
	                    	but a combination of a great song, a great collaboration and a cool upfront production, all add up to something 
	                    	which can prick the ears of any good standing A&amp;R person.</p>
	                    <p> Think outside the box and don't be scared to experiment! Work with others you wouldn't naturally choose to collaborate

	                    	commercial sounding rock / hip hop record? They were dead against the collaboration, but their management insisted 
	                    	on this happening and to this day they are sure glad they did, we all know that record was their biggest hit!</p>
