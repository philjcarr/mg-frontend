	                    <p>	The title came from back in the day when the job involved finding the best songs for a singer or act to perform, hence the term artist and repertoire. Nowadays its come to be shorthand for...well, everyone has their own view. For some its the person who spots potential and builds a good working relationship which leads to musical success for the signing and a life of excess for the A&amp;R. For others it's the nephew or niece of one of the company directors who turns up late at gigs and huddles near the back with his or her fellow A&amp;R whilst they collectively form an individual opinion.</p>
	                    <p>Whatever your view on A&amp;R, its fair to say that if you want to sign a label or publishing deal, they - and their scout's out on point duty - are the people you'll need to impress. Like any profession, there's good and less good amongst the crowd but we believe that most of those signed bands that you love, were signed by good judgement rather than good luck.</p>
	                    <p>Research! There is little sense in targeting every label and publisher in existence. Research those that you think will be a good fit for the music you make. Don't rush it. If you feel the need to say 'This is where the guitar solo should go' every time you hear your demo, then its not finished. Remember you're trying to build a relationship. Do it right and you'll get more than one chance. Do it wrong, and you may not even get that. And don't worry too much about A&amp;R interest. Focus on being good. If you do that well enough, they will find you.</p>
