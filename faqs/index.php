	                <div id="ten">
	                    <p>Interim payments have many benefits for both the project worker and the project owner, first of all anyone 
	                    	making an interim payment to another user, does this with the peace of mind, that the payments cannot be 
	                    	accessed or released until the project owner signs off the payment for release to the project worker. 
	                    	The worker has confidence that the Project Owner has the available funds to pay them at the end of the Project. 
	                    	Interim payments can't be accessed by the Project Owner, only to release to the worker. By default, an Interim 
	                    	Payment request is issued to the Project Owner for 50 per cent of the project cost, before work is started. 
	                    	However this is not compulsory and the decision whether to use Interim Payments is entirely down to each user 
	                    	and the terms they stipulate on a project by project basis.</p>
	                    <p>Having said this we do recommend that project workers ask for a 50% per cent Interim payment from the Project Owner, 
	                    	which can be released at the end of the Project. Once you have accepted the Project and pay us our fee, you can start 
	                    	working on the job.</p>
	                    <p>Once the project work is completed and signed off by the Project Owner, users can request sign off for any outstanding 
	                    	Interim Payments. Once the final audio files are delivered, the Project Owner will release the Interim payments into 
	                    	your account and both parties will provide feedback to each other.</p>

	                    Q. Do you have tips on pitching and how best to secure Project work?
	                    <span class="arrow"><!-- Arrow --></span>

	                <div id="eighteen">
	                    <p>We recommend that you put yourself in the shoes of the Project Worker, first of all, take care and attention in reading the Project 
	                    	description and the requirements for the Project work and before pitching, ensure you meet the needs of the Project? Be clear with 
	                    	what you offer and any guarantees on the Project, also ensure that your Profile is fully completed and up to date with your best music.</p>
	                    <p>Once you have established that you want to pitch on a Project, do the following:</p>
	                    <p>+ Check your Profile is fully up to date, with good description of your Biog, you can defined your skills &amp; music genres. Note that any 
	                    	Project Owner's will review your public profile when reviewing your pitch.</p>
	                    <p>+ Give a good description and detail on your pitch, if there is anything you wish to offer as added value or for extra or an additional 
	                    	reason why you believe you are the best person to provide the work.</p>
	                    <p>+ Point out any specific audio you have created or worked on that showcases your experience, and is also relevant to the Project in question. 
	                    	This will make things much easier for the project owner to review.</p>
	                    <p>+ If you have a question or need more information, then it's always good to ask and get some dialogue going, communicate and show how keen 
	                    	you are to secure the project.</p>
	                    <p>+ Your pitching price. It isn't about being the cheapest, it depends on the Project and what the Project owner is looking to have done, but 
	                    	remember, the majority of people will always look at quality first, the price second and then weigh up their options. Consider where you 
	                    	are in the industry ladder, do you have a proven track record, or are you happy to work at a lower price to gain credibility in the long run. 
	                    	The principle is that you are offering your services as a business, so be professional at all times and give the Project Owner the confidence 
	                    	that you are the right person for the Project.</p>

						<p>+ Manage and access to your Project Files - Maintain the control the access to your audio files with any project &amp; project 
							worker via our secure workspace areas. Music Gateway acts as a secure cloud based backup for project files, keeping them in 
							one secure location.</p>
						<p>+ Send, receive and withdraw funds - Securely via your account and our platform. Any payments made outside the site may not 
							have the same protection or workflow security offered by Music Gateway.</p>
						<p>+ Receive clear career development & progression - From within the site with Project Feedback. Each Project feedback provides 
							you with a ranking, which defines your positioning when pitching for Project work. The more Projects you complete, the greater 
							the ranking.</p>
						<p>+ Our worker fixed fees are linked to a percentage of the monies you receive; therefore you are never out of pocket if securing 
							project work.</p>
						<p>+ Keep Secure - Maintain the ability to raise an issue or dispute via our platform. If working independently outside our platform, 
							this leaves you with little to no protection should something go wrong.</p>

	                    <p>Standard Projects are designed so the Project Owner can pay a one off fee for work supplied on an existing recording and no more

	                    	is for example a co-write or collaboration, then Publishing splits will need to be agreed between the parties, either at 
	                    	#outset of the project or finalisation of the Project work. We cannot mediate between parties or be involved in any dispute 
	                    	of terms. We recommend that you seek professional legal advice, when agreeing project terms.</p>
	                    <p>For guidance only, if you believe that you have a clear publishing right to work supplied during a project, we recommend that
