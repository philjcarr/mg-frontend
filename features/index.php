					<h3>Register. Create. Define Skills. Get Connected!</h3>
					<p>Registration is simple. Once verified you can create your online profile, this doubles as your public portfolio. You can represent yourself, any roster you control or artists that you have permission to manage. Furthermore, you can profile a business or company such as a record label, publisher or agency.</p>
					<p>Upload your audio which best reflects your talent &amp; skills &amp; services you offer. You can login via Facebook &amp; Soundcloud whereby we will automatically transfer your music to your account.</p>
					<p>Defining your skills will determine the potential work opportunities &amp; notifications you receive. Users will be informed about posted projects that are relevant to their skills. Posted projects are how users connect through Music Gateway.</p>
					<p>You can also upload images of yourself, your artists or a business you represent.</p>
					<p>Completing projects generates feedback for both the project owner &amp; the worker. Your feedback acts as a site ranking &amp; increases your site positioning when pitching for work and gives the project worker more confidence in you from the beginning.</p>

						<p>Music Gateway is like no other music service. Yes we are a business platform, but we are not like LinkedIn. We support your career, but 
							we don't sell, distribute or promote your music directly to the public like so many other sites.</p>
						<p>Allow us to explain... Millions of people use LinkedIn, in fact +200 million worldwide. LinkedIn does have benefits, networking groups &amp; 
							connecting to new clients &amp; keeping that work CV up to scratch.</p>
						<p>As far as the Music Industry is concerned, LinkedIn connections can be fairly random, and then nothing tends to happen. Sound familiar? 
							The main reason is that connections aren't linked to a purpose, an end goal or an objective! 
							LinkedIn &amp; many other sites don't provide work flow functionality &amp; that all important end result.</p>
						<p>So, what's different about Music Gateway? In one word "Projects".</p>

					<p>Workspace areas are secure, offering protection by a 2048 bit SSL Certificate. Our communication features include timeline feedback on audio files, plus project member messaging &amp; comments.</p>
