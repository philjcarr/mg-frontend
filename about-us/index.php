					get connected.

					better with equal opportunities via our unique platform.

					Music Gateway connects the talent to the projects. Developed by musicians, for musicians, we help 
					break down barriers that hinder career development by empowering individuals and companies alike. 
					We provide a global business platform for professionals and aspiring pros to find session work, 
					collaborate and seek out the right talent that meets the needs of their own projects. Music Gateway 
					removes time consuming legwork and offers security, unique tools and multiple work opportunities.
