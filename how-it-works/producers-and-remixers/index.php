					Most producers are multi functional and talented individuals, you may class yourself strictly as a record producer, 
					but you may well write songs and offer other specialist services including artist development and management of 
					new artists. Your role is to bring to life a song and best meet the client's needs.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Music Gateway allows you to receive work opportunities, further your career, develop your skills and 
					provide your services to clients from around the world. We give you the vehicle to place your music with 
					likeminded professionals, commission work from session musicians and manage any personal projects through 
					our unique platform.
				</p>
				<p>
					We aren't a traditional network, as we introduce clients in a targeted timesaving way, which stream lines the 
					whole process. You can collaborate, receive work and connect with other industry roles, such as singers, 
					songwriters, artists, bands, record labels, publishers, management and musicians on a global scale.  
				</p>
				<h3>This is how it works</h3>
				<p>
					Simply <a href="/sign-up" title="Register" class="">register</a> and create your industry profile. This acts as your music portfolio and displayed to other users. 
					It outlines your experience, skills, services, genres, video, audio and images. You can only get connected 
					and receive work through projects posted on Music Gateway.
				</p>
				<p>
					When a project is published, we match the details to your profile and send you a notification making 
					the opportunity targeted and relevant.
				</p>
				<p>
					You are then able to review, pitch (also known as tending or quoting) for work and communicate privately 
					with the client to discuss the details or negotiate any terms. Project owners can pre-qualify workers by 
					reviewing their profile and listening to their music.
				</p>
				<p>
					Music Gateway provides opportunity from both company and individual clients. You are also able to manage 
					your own projects and reach out to other professionals on a global scale.
				</p>  
				<h3>How do projects work?</h3>
				<p>
					Projects are how you get connected to other professionals around the world, by defining a need or providing 
					an opportunity, we match the details to user profiles, streamlining the whole process.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can easily pre-qualify users pitching using our management tools, together with private messaging to 
					discuss and negotiate any terms.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each project is provided a unique and secure workspace, allowing for remote working features, global 
					communication tools, file transfers and management of worker submissions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Music Gateway is an all-in-one solution for any music project.
				</p>
				<h3>What is pitching?</h3>
				<p>
					Based on your profile, we sent your notifications of any relevant project work posted. You can easily 
					review the project details and then pitch (also known as tendering or quoting) for the work. 
					Depending on the project type, your pitch may include the fixed cost to supply your services or may 
					be a request to collaborate and co-write with the user.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can include private messages and discuss, negotiate any terms for each project. If your pitch is 
					successful you are notified and can still chose to accept or reject their acceptance. Only at this 
					juncture is either a commission or connection fee payable.*
				</p> 
				<h3>Are there any fees or costs?</h3>
				<p>
					All projects are free to post, excluding our premium On Spec project type. Charges are only payable 
					if a user receives paid work or a connection.  
				</p>
				<p>
					The level of fees depends on the type of account you choose and there is a free account option available. 
					Note that regardless of the account type, we never take any form of royalty or publishing percentage 
					% whatsoever.

					looking to license music, so boot up those hard drives, as you can monetise any existing works through Music Gateway.
