				<h2>Songwriters</h2>
				<p>
					You’re a producer, you want to earn money, get hired and match your music with client needs.
					Well that is exactly what we do! We stream line the way you make connections and receive work 
					from singers, artists &amp; bands around the world, together with publishers and record labels 
					looking to sign high quality production music.
				</p>
				<h3>Remixers &amp; Remix work</h3>
				<p>
					We have a wealth of remix work provided from a host of established Record Labels around the 
					world and direct from independent artists, some of these include xxxxxxxxxx
				</p>
				<h3>Collaborate &amp; Co-write</h3>
				<p>
					As Producers, using our Collaboration Project type allows you to co-write and work with 
					likeminded professionals on agreed terms.
				</p>
				<h3>How can I utilize my existing music &amp; productions?</h3>
				<p>
					If you own the master rights you can use our Collaboration Project type to match your music 
					with other users needs. We also have a number of Publishers regularly looking for music to sign, 
					so boot up those hard drives, as you can monetize any existing works through Music Gateway.
				</p>
				<h3>How does it work?</h3>
				<ul class="funkyBullet">
					<li>Once registered for free you set up your industry profile</li>
					<li>Users post projects, defining their project need</li>
					<li>We notify you of relevant project work</li>
					<li>You review and PITCH (tender) for the work</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Only if you secure the work will we charge an 11% commission on 
					fixed free work or a small connection fee if you are collaborating.
				</p>
				<p>
					Music Gateway is 100% free until the point you receive paid project work or a beneficial 
					connection when collaborating. There are no hidden charges, posting projects are free* 
					and we never take any form of royalty or publishing percentage whatsoever.
				</p>
				<p class="innerTerm">* All projects types are free to post except for our ‘On Spec’ project type</p>
				<h3>Transactions &amp; Getting paid</h3>
				<p>
					You manage and control transactions within a currency account. This allows you to receive, 
					deposit and withdraw funds, trading within our global market place. All payments are securely 
					held within legally protected client accounts in three denominations, US Dollars, UK pounds and Euros.
				</p>
				<h3>Protection &amp; Piece of mind</h3>
				<p>
					When receiving fixed fee work, you can request advance Interim payments, which are like escrow style holding 
					payments. We use the very best SSL 2048 bit sever protection and security for your files and account access. 
					Payments are processed through PacNet a global market leader is e-commerce and PayPal.
				</p>
				<h3>File transfers &amp; Remote working</h3>
				<p>
					Each project is provided with a secure workspace area which allows you and your project workers to manage 
					project files. Your workers can access and download stems and submit back their work for your review. 
					We provide communication tools and timeline feedback on audio files. Check out FEATURES page for full details.
